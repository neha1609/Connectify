# Connectify
This is our Hackathon Project for the SRIIH Hackathon 2021.
Our Idea for this Hackathon was to __help in regaining education in rural areas in post COVID-19 situation.__
Our approach to this problem was _to design a software which will be an interface connecting the rural students with some organizations or vendors that can provide them educational requirements at low cost._

##Brief Introduction to files
For implementing the above solution, we have done the following:
1. We made an e-commerce website consisting of admin and customer portals respectively.
2. In [admin portal](https://github.com/neha1609/Connectify/tree/main/Back%20end/admin), 
    -Admin can insert, edit, delete and view various customers, delivery agents and vendors.
    -Admin can contact vendors and delivery agents.
    -Also admin can receive orders from gmail automatically just by the click of button [**Gmail Order**](#Gmail Order).
3. In customer portal(_in Back end folder_), 
    -Customer can view all items in Books, Stationary and Study Material pages
    -Customer can **add to cart** the requirements and checkout offline or online by their interests.

##Gmail Order

These files include our website, our 2 months hardwork for the project.
